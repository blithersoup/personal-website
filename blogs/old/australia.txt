# Aussie Road Trip from Sydney to Melbourne

December 30, 2023

This blog details a trip to Australia that I took at the end of my study abroad semester with my 
friends Hugo and Miko≈Çai.

We began the trip by flying into Sydney, picking up the rental car, and driving to Bondi beach.  After 
 exploring the area in the afternoon, we decided to head to the opera house to catch the symphony that 
evening.  We were not sure if we could get in, but ended up getting good tickets inside.

The next day, we did a couple hikes in the Blue Mountains near Sydney.  We started with Grose River Lookout via Faulconbridge and then drove over to Fortress Ridge, finishing late.

We then drove down the coast to Wollongong, where we spent our afternoon.

We then finished the remainder of the drive to Durras North and camped there.  We got to see plenty of 
kangaroos and bright stars.

The next morning, we took a hike along the shoreline from Depot Beach to near Pebbly Beach.

After the hike, we had a long car ride to our next stop, Wilsons Promontory.

At Wilsons Promontory, we checked out the dunes at Big Drift, which were some sand dunes overlooking the ocean.

After that, we hiked Mount Bishop and visited Squaky Beach, which had sand that squeaked when walked on.

The next morning, we drove on the Melbourne F1 course, which is open as a public road most 
of the time.  I then flew back to Singapore.
