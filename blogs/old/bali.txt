# Spring Break Trip to Bali and Jakarta

April 5, 2023

This blog covers the second half of my spring break trip, in which I traveled to Bali 
and Jakarta.  The trip began the morning after I got back from Malaysia.  Due to this 
fact (and because my alarm was set to the quietest possible volume), I may have not 
woken up in time for my flight and had to leave later in the day.  The photos start 
from the day after I flew in.

We stayed in Kuta, which is in the south of the island.  To begin the day, we took a 
taxi from our residence to Ubud, which was a bit over an hour drive north.  We walked 
the streets and saw a few sights, and then took a hike up a hill nearby.

We then decided to go to a Bali swing a short distance out of town.

After the swing, we took a taxi to a nearby rice field to see some sights.

The plan after that was to head to a gate and then to a large temple, but we ran 
out of daylight before heading to the temple.  There was also a holiday during our 
stay, so the roads in some areas we went to were packed.  We stayed at the gate for 
a short bit and then took a long drive back.

The next day, the group went on an ATV tour in the morning and headed to the beach 
in the evening.  We hung out and swam at the beach for a while, and headed before our 
flight the next morning.

We spent the next day in Jakarta.  First, we checked into the hotel where one group 
member was staying.  We then walked to Chinatown, which was a short distance away.

We then headed to the center of the city to view the city from atop the national 
monument.  We saw the museum of Indonesian history inside, and checked out the skyline 
from the observation deck.

We then headed to our stay for the night, which was an apartment halfway to the 
airport.  It was nice but very difficult to find.

The next morning, myself and a few others tried to sightsee before heading to the 
airport.  Getting there, however, we got dropped off at the wrong location and walked 
an hour and a half towards where we thought our destination was.  As it turns out, we 
navigated to the wrong location and were dropped in the wrong place for that as 
well.  It was still fun to walk along the road, and we headed to the airport once we 
ran out of time.

As this blog was heavily delayed, below is a bonus mini-blog about my day trip to 
Johor Bahru in Malaysia.  In short, myself and a friend took a train to and from the 
border, and took taxis to random sites around the city.
