# Trip to Phuket and Phi Phi Islands, Thailand

April 7, 2023

This blog is on my four day trip to Phuket and Phi Phi Islands, Thailand.  The trip 
began with my group flying from Singapore to Phuket on Thursday afternoon.

After we landed, we got in a taxi that turned out to be a party bus and drove an hour 
to our hostel.  The hostel was very nice, and we put our things away before checking out 
some of the nearby streets.

The next day, we rode to Kamala beach, which was a 45 minute drive north.

We hung out at that beach for most of the day, and then watched the sunset on the beach 
closer to our hostel.

The next day, we took a ferry to Koh Phi Phi Don, where we would stay for the next two nights.

Once there, we had dinner and hiked to a sightseeing spot near the top of one side of the island.

The next day, we woke up early and did a boat tour of some surrounding areas.

We first swam in a lagoon; the water was great.

We then went to Maya bay, which is apparently the location of ‘The Beach (2000)’.  
I have never seen the movie, but as it turns out Phi Phi Islands gained most of their 
popularity after its release.

We then headed back and had a relaxing afternoon.  A few hours later, Hugo and I decided 
to go kayaking in the bay near our hostel.  We made it almost to sea, and got to see a cool 
rock formation near the ocean.

The next day all we did was head back to Singapore.  Overall, I had a great time and 
thoroughly enjoyed the trip.
