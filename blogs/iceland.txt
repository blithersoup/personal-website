# A Week in Iceland

This spring break, I traveled to Iceland with my friend Hugo.  This blog 
is longer than my earlier ones, and in my opinion the pictures do not do 
Iceland justice; each place we saw was breathtaking.  After a late night 
arrival, we began the first day with a hike.

The hike was up and over a tall hill, and we were a little lost the whole 
time.  Along the way, we saw some interesting rock formations and plants.

Next, we started our journey along highway 1 to see the Reykjadalur hot 
springs.

The hot springs were the perfect temperature, and we bathed in them for 
over an hour.

We then drove south to our hostel for the night.  The next morning, we 
saw the Reynisfjara black sand beach.

Afterwards, we drove to our next activity: hiking on Falljökull, part 
of the massive Vatnajökull glacier.

We hiked on the ice for several hours and even got to drink water off of the glacier!

That afternoon, we stopped at the Jökulsárlón glacial lagoon for lunch and 
made the drive to our hostel for the night in Höfn.  The next day, we drove 
to Egilsstaðir, finding hikes along the way.

For the whole trip, the weather changed rapidly with small differences 
in location and elevation.  Our next hike was very cold, and we saw 
Dettifoss, Europe's most powerful waterfall.

Our second hike of the day was to Ásbyrgi, a glacial horseshoe canyon.  Very neat!

Our third hike was just as cold and to Goðafoss.

The next morning, we headed to Reykjavik for the remainder of the trip. On 
the way, we stopped for a quick hike in a crater and saw the Settlement Center in Borgarnes.

In Reykjavik, we saw the Perlan natural history museum and went whale watching 
the next day.  The weather was intense, and we got to see a humpback whale!

On this day, we also checked out the Whales of Iceland museum, the International 
Phallological Museum, and the Reykjavík Art Museum Hafnarhús.  In our time in 
Reykjavik, we also trekked around the coast of the city and got to walk through 
some neighborhoods.

The next day we drove the 'Golden Circle', which is a loop that 
has several natural attractions along it.  We first saw some geysers, 
then the Gullfoss waterfall, and then a short hike to the Flúðir 
Tarn glacial lake.

We ended our final day with a trip to the lava show, which was 
excellent.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this trip and had a 
great time.
